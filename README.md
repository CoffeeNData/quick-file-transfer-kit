# The Quick File Transfer Kit

## INFO

### What is this?
It's just a little script I've rewritten a few times to make it a bit more comfortable to use

### What are these scripts for?
As the name suggests, it is just a pair of scripts to **infiltrate** and **exfiltrate** files between Unix-based systems, using your localhost as cluster on every transfer.

### How does this work?
This asks for parameters to generate quick-deployable oneliner. Once the command is generated, it starts up the server using ```nc```. Then, you can easily kill the server with 'Ctrl + C'.

### Is this some kind of bullshit?
It's possible

## INSTALLATION

* It has ONLY one dependency: ```nc```. It should be preinstalled on your distro
* You can run them directly from the cloned folder, but for better performance I recommend executing the install script.
* If you don't like these scripts, you can easily get rid of them by running the uninstall script.

## DISCLAIMER

I do NOT take care of any damage or any trouble you make.
Please, don't use this for illegal purposes.
